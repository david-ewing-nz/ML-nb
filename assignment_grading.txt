how you trained the algorithms to predict binary and multiclass outcomes. Y ou should describe
the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms and how you chose the hyperparameter values
that you used. Y ou should explain any decisions that you made about feature selection, splitting,
sampling, hyperparameters, and metrics. Y ou should discuss the performance of the algorithms
and talk about how you would do hyperparameter tuning.

have done, and discuss any insights that you had. Y ou should talk about any tasks that you were
unable to complete and explain why.
Song recommendations
• Y ou should describe the distributions of user-song play counts, describe any choices you had to
make to use this data for collaborative filtering, and talk about the performance of the collaborative
filtering model using specific examples and the ranking metrics that you have evaluated.
• Y ou should explain the implications of the choices you had to make, discuss any other systems
that you would need to generate recommendations forallusers of your service, and discuss any
other considerations for using the collaborative filtering model to generate recommendations.
• Y ou should answer the questions that have been asked, include visualizations, give a high level
summary of what you have done, and discuss any insights that you had.

Processing
This section is about developing your understanding of thestructureof the data and setting up code
that you will need to load and join the datasets so that you can use them to develop models and answer
questions in the audio similarity and song recommendations sections.
Answers
• Names, sizes, formats, data types, and number of rows in each of the datasets.
Reasoning
• A brief summary of the information that is contained in the audio attributes datasets and why
these are separate from the audio features datasets.
• A clear explanation of how you used these to create a StructType automatically, including any
additional processing.
• A clear explanation of how you renamed columns in the audio feature datasets. Y ou should
explain any decisions that you made and why. Answers to any other questions that you have
been asked.
Tables
• A table containing names, sizes, formats, data types, and number of rows in each of the datasets.
Visualizations
• A directory tree showing how the datasets are organized.

Audio similarity
This section is about demonstrating that you can develop binary and multiclass classification algorithms
to predict the genre of a track from audio based features.
Y ou should demonstrate your understanding of the audio feature datasets, how to prepare suitable
features for training, how to train binary and multiclass classification algorithms, and how to evalute
their performance effectively. Y ou should also demonstrate your knowledge of hyperparameter tuning
in theory.
Answers
• The class balance of the binary classification target as a count and a proportion or ratio.
• Sensible values for binary accuracy, precision, and recall.
• Sensible values for multiclass performance metrics that account for class balance in some way.

• A brief summary of the audio features datasets based on your background reading.
• Any conclusions that you can make from the descriptive statistics and if they will influence how
you train or inference your model.
• A clear explanation of any choices you need to make based on how the features are correlated.
• A comment on the distribution of genres and how it will affect your performance metrics.
• A clear explanation of how you have split the dataset into training and test sets, including any
stratification or resampling techniques that you have used.
• A clear explanation of each classification algorithm that takes into account their explainability,
interpretability, predictive accuracy, training speed, hyperparameter tuning, dimensionality, and
any additional preprocessing that might be required.
• A clear explanation of how logistic regression can be used for multiclass classification and if there
are any additional assumptions that need to be satisfied.
